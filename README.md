# Chat Data Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a dataset named `data.csv`, which likely contains information related to chat interactions. The analysis includes statistical summaries, visualizations, and initial insights to better understand the structure and characteristics of the chat data.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
📦ChatBot Interaction.ipynb  
└── 📄 data.csv (not provided in this repo)
```

## 📊 Features

- Data loading using `pandas`
- Summary statistics and data types overview
- Visual analysis using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
- Structure inspection (`df.head()`, `df.describe()`, `df.info()`)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

## 🧠 Objective

To perform a preliminary analysis of chat-based data and uncover basic statistical properties and potential patterns that may help guide further machine learning or natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Ensure `data.csv` is available in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebook.

## 📌 Notes

- The dataset (`data.csv`) must be available locally for the notebook to execute.
- This notebook is suitable as a foundation for more advanced chatbot or NLP pipeline development.
